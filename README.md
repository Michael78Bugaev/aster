Aster is not Linux, it is a simple kernel for small tasks.
At the moment of development (at the last moment of the 
README.md commit), this kernel can do little. It cannot 
connect to the Internet, does not have its own compiler, 
and does not even have a text editor! But it has support 
for small FAT16, IDE drives, PIC timer, IDT interrupts, 
its own command shell SASH (Super Aster Shell) and support 
for a keyboard with a screen. 

I am developing a project alone and am looking for a team 
of developers like me.

Welcome to Aster Kernel!
